                  <br/>
                  <p> <b>We are open Monday to Friday from 8 am to 6 pm and 8 am to 1 pm on Saturdays.<br/>
                    <br>Please note that we do not provide any bulk billing on weekends and public holidays.</b><br/>
                    Bulk Billing is done at the discretion of the general 
                    practitioner. You are requested to pay your account on the day. When doing a phone consult, the doctor will let you know about the fee. A staff from 
                    the admin team will be calling you later in the day for payment which can be made over the phone or through direct deposit. Please speak to our friendly 
                    admin staff if you would like to pay in installments and they would help you set it up. <br/>
                    <br/>
                    The theatre fee for procedures is charged on top of the consult. Your doctor will let you know how much to expect if you are getting a procedure done. The theatre
                    fee you pay will be out of pocket as there is no Medicare rebate available for theatre fees.<br/>
                   <br/>
                    We have a 24-hour cancellation policy and you are requested to let us know in time if you would like to cancel a booking. Late notice of cancellation 
                    or no-show may incur a non-attendance fee of $50.
