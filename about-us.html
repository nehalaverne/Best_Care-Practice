            Best Care Clinic was established by Dr. Knight in 1984 at another site opposite 
            Woolworths on the intersection of Andeson Street and Reynolds Road. <br/>We soon realised that we would 
            have to expand and move to a bigger site to help more and more patients that 
            were after Medical Care. A new site was also required to increase parking spaces for the number
            of patients who started following us.<br/>
            The clinic was completely rebuilt in 2012 at the present location.
            Dr. Bo joined the clinic in 1992 and quickly developed a significant 
            patient base. <br/>More doctors were then added to the team and our team now 
            comprises of 15 personnel including the members of our friendly <br/>and helpful reception team, 
            Maria, Lianne, Daphne, Tanya and Georgia. We have three practice nurses, Nicky, Kristy and Michelle.<br/>
            <br/>
            Best Care Practice became fully accredited by AGPAL (Australian General Practice Accreditation 
            Limited) in 2013<br/>which means we offer excellent medical care.
            <br/>We are fully computerised so that all medical records <br/>are secure and backed up in multiple ways so that your medical records are safe and 
            secure with us. This ensures future use and easy access to your Medical History.<br/>
            
            We provide care when you need it and hence have on-the-day appointments available for our patients. 
            <br/>
            We also do telehealth and telephone consults for patients who can physically attend the clinic for various reasons.</p>
