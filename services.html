                    <h2>Immunisations </h2>
                    <p> Immunisations help protect individuals against harmful and 
                        deadly diseases. Immunisations also prevent spread of such
                        diseases in the community. Along with adult immunisations we 
                        also run and support the National Immunisation Program which
                        includes vaccinating children over a course of period for
                        total of 16 diseases.

                    <p> It is recommended to have full skin skin checks once a year.
                        Our doctors specialise in skin cancer screening and use advanced 
                        dermatoscopes to spot early signs of changes in the skin. The doctors can
                        also help in excising skin cancers by performing biopsy.
