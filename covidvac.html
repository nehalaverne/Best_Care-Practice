                    <li> WHY SHOULD I GET THE COVID VACCINE?
                    It is recommended to get the COVID vaccine as it can help prevent the infection or have milder symptoms if you have it. Having the vaccine also helps 
                    to stop the spread of the virus in the community. Also the government has made it free for everyone.</li>
                  
                    <li>WHEN SHOULD I GET MY NEXT DOSE?<br/>
                    It is recommended to have at least four weeks break between two doeses of COVID vaccine.</li>
                    
                    <li>CAN I GET THE FLU INJECTION WITH MY COVID VACCINE?
                    Yes, you can have both the vaccines on the same day.</li>
                            
                    <li>WILL THERE BE ANY SIDE EFFECTS OF THE VACCINE?
                    Like all the other vaccines, COVID vaccine has been preapred and tested to be safe for human use. There are still chnaces of having some mild 
                    reactions like body ache, headache, chills, tierdness, mild fever and mild cold and flu. A few doses of Panadol should be enough to relieve such symptoms.
                    You are advsied to speak to your doctor if you are concerned about health after having the vaccine. Please see your dcotor if you symptoms persist longer
                    than  five days. Please call 000 or go to the hospital if you are having breathing difficulties.</li>
